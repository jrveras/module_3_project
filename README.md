## Describe SLO/SLI
### Describe, in your own words, what the SLIs are, based on an SLO of *monthly uptime* and *request response time*.

SLI is an artifact that collects information and is used to measure availability.
SLIs could measure uptime, latency, or the proportion between success interactions for a specific period of time e.g. week, month; that means. We will aggregate interactions that donâ€™t throw an exception or return an HTTP error or take more than a specific period of time to produce a result and define error policies as a playbook to reduce the likelihood or mitigate future problems.

## Creating SLI metrics.

- SLI Uptime = # Uptime in minutes / # Total minutes per period
- SLI Errors = # Requests different than 5XX / # Total requests per period 
- SLI Errors = # Requests different than 4XX / # Total requests per period
- SLI Latency = # Requests with latency < 1000ms / # Total Requests per period

SLI must help product owners find an easy way to understand and define an SLO, in that way would be much appropriate to work with latency in seconds or milliseconds rather than proportions.

- SLI Latency = Latency value for 99% of users.

## Report Error
### TROUBLE TICKET

- Name: Application temporary unavailable
- Date: 15/04/2022
- Subject: Service Unavailable
- Affected Area: Backend - /api
- Severity: 7.0 - High
- Description: The application is unstable and frequently showing the follow message: Service Unavailable. Please contact the System Admnistrator.

![Jaeger Ticket Tracing](answer-img/07-Ticket-Tracing.png)

## Creating SLIs and SLOs
SLO: The Applications need to have a 99.95% uptime per month. 
SLI:
- CPU Saturation (Saturation)
- how many error messages we are seeing (Errors)
- how many success messages we are seeing (Success)
- Request Response time of the Apis (Latency)

## Building KPIs for our plan
1. SLI: Total successful http requests is more than or equal to 99.95% in a month
2. SLI: Total failing http requests is less than or equal to 0.05% in a month (40x and 50x)
3. SLI: The CPU usage up till 75%
4. SLI: The Memory usage up till 50%
